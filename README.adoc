Program reads a file. In the future is gonna transform it and save the results to another file.
The file contains in each line key-value pair where key is a number of type Long and value is number of type Double.
Transformation is called normalization.
The transformation must scale all values to fit the [-1; 1] interval.
Where max is 1, min -1. The output file must preserve the input fileâ€™s key-value order.
The file can contain billions of rows and may not fit in memory.
For sample values: [1000.0, 2000.0, 100.0, 10000.0] the result is: [-0.818182, -0.616162, -1, 1]
normalization expression: ((x - min) * 2 / max - min) - 1 == Dependencies
